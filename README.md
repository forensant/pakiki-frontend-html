## Overview
Pakiki is an intercepting proxy, allowing you to view and manipulate network requests between your web browser and the servers its communicating with. It is designed for web application penetration testing, but could be used for general debugging of applications, etc. It is similar in principle to mitmproxy or OWASP ZAP.

It takes the philosophy of do one thing, and do it well. The intent is not to pack in features which are rarely, if ever, used in practice. This is especially true where good quality standalone tools already exist.

This repository contains the html frontend used to view the proxied traffic and perform other key functions.  The web interface is intended to be used for forward deployments, quick testing, or where the desktop interfaces won't otherwise run. It's not as polished as or as featureful as the dedicated desktop interface(s).

One of the reasons for developing this is to give back to the community. I want to help people who are new to pentesting, while still having 99% of what experienced pentesters need day to day.

Feedback would be greatly appreciated.
